PHPoAuthLib
============================

This PHP library provides interfaces and base implementations for OAuth 2.0 (done/pre-alpha) and OAuth 1.0 (WIP).
It requires the Artax HTTP client library. Artax is included as a git submodule.

The library follows the PSR-0 autoloading standard in order to achieve interoperability with compliant projects.
