PHP oAuth 2.0 Client Library
============================

This PHP library helps you to implement an OAuth 2.0 client. It is currently being rewritten.
It requires the Artax HTTP client library. Install it as a git submodule and include the bootstrap file, Artax.php

Each extension of AbstractService should define a specific OpenID provider such as google or that one site with the blue and white logo.
